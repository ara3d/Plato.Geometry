# Plato.Geometry

**Plato.Geometry** is a multi-language geometry kernel. In
other words it is a math and geometry library that is appropriate for usage in 
3D Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), and 
Digital Content Creation (DCC) software. 

## C# Today - Tomorrow C++, JavaScript, and Beyond 

Plato.Geometry is currently delivered as a C# library, but the roadmap includes C++ and JavaScript support. 

All algorithms and data structures are written in a high-level programming language called Plato
which makes porting to different languages easier. 

## About Plato 

[Plato](https://github.com/cdiggins/Plato) is designed specifically for helping to write efficient low-level libraries in a 
straightforward manner, with less boilerplate. 

* All data types are read-only 
* No abstraction penalty
* Operator overloading
* Default implementations for:
  * Converting to strings
  * Equality Comparison
  * Generating hash code 
  * Parsing strings
  * Implicit conversion to/from tuples

The Plato tool-chain parses, analyzes, optimizes, and generates code.  

## Why? 

Basic mathematical and geometry algorithms and data structures continue to be written
over and over again. We can find thousands or more versions of the same algorithm 
written with various bugs and limitations, in different styles and languages.
